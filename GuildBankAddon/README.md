# Guild Bank

A World of Warcraft Classic addon providing members of The Order access to a guild bank.

Since guild banks weren't an official thing until The Burning Crusadeâ„¢, we have to do things the Classic way. The guild bank is spread over nine different characters on a separate WoW account owned and operated by the Inner Circle.

This addon profiles the bags and bank contents of the designated bank characters, then using an external desktop API uploads the data to be displayed on The Order's official website.
